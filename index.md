## Lucas Moura Veloso

Welcome to my portfolio page! 
This is where I keep track of my favourite personal projects that are open to everybody to use!

### Markdown flow

>👨‍💻 https://github.com/lucas-mv/markdown-flow

I really like this one, it is a flowchart generator from `markdown` code. I created this to help me out describing flowcharts in an easy way, and have a readable documentation at the same time.

### CSS Animation roadtrippin'

>👨‍💻 https://github.com/lucas-mv/dti-css-contest

This is not exactly a project, but I really liked doing it! It was my entry for a `Cool stuff that you can do with CSS` project we held at [dti](https://github.com/lucas-mv/dti-css-contest).

### Pipa, the twitter trending topics friend
>🌐 https://pipa-tts.herokuapp.com/?address=rua%20roquete%20mendon%C3%A7a,%2064,%20belo%20horizonte
>
>👨‍💻 https://github.com/lucas-mv/pipa

Pipa is a tool that I developed to fetch twitter trending topics based on location and show them in a cli friendly interface. You can call it via browser but I had originally intended it to be used on a terminal.
### SonarQube report generator
>👨‍💻 https://github.com/dtidigitalcrafters/SonarQube-Report-Generator

This is a project I made together with [Felipe Chagas](https://github.com/chagretes) to generate a `markdown` report from [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org)'s API. The idea was to automate the export of that report and send it daily via email to all the devs that work on a specific project.

### Klatt voice synthesizer
>👨‍💻 https://github.com/lucas-mv/klatt

This is an academic work I did for the final year project for my graduation in Electrical Engineering at UFMG. It is a `python` version of the [Klatt voice synthesizer](https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/plab/guestwiki/index.php?title=Klatt_Synthesizer) with some changes to reproduce voices with some pathology in the vocal cords, to help identify illnesses of the vocal tract.
